# The Optical Corrections in Design

## Overshoot

While I was exploring various design concepts in type design, one thing stood out as it is counterintuitive upon first look. It is the idea of "overshoot". As defined in _The Graphic Design Reference + Specification Book_, overshoot is "the degree to which capital letters go below the baseline or above the cap height, or to which a lowercase letter goes below the baseline or above the x-height." [@evans_graphic_2013] To put it in a more visual way, it is the design that intentionally extends a letter, like A and O, higher than other letters, like X and H, so that they appear to be the same size. The image below shows that the letter Q (partially) is higher than I (shown partially on the left) and U (shown partially on the right) [@frere-jones_typeface_2015].

A such design like "overshoot" is one example of optical correction. The reason we need it is that our brain treats square objects and round shapes differently. The GIF below showed that even though the circle has the same diameter as the length of the square, the circle appeared to be smaller [@frere-jones_typeface_2015]. Only when we enlarge the circle a bit in both directions, do they appear to be of the same height. Such strange inner workings of our brains necessitate overshoot as a principle in type design to maintain optical equality.

In fact, there are many other strange mechanisms in our brain that prompt bizarre design paradigms just to exploit these "gimmicks".

## Gestalt Principles

The Gestalt Principles of visual design is a set of rules long adopted by designers. I won't go into detail about these because they are tons of articles explaining the Gestalt principles, for example, [this blog](https://www.canva.com/learn/gestalt-theory/) here. However, I could not resist the temptation of putting the two famous logos which utilize the Closure principle to convey their message succinctly.

The two logos used the closure principles to depict a panda and an arrow, which draws our attention to the visual elements upon the first look. We are able to see a panda and an arrow because we subconsciously close the contour of the shapes. The such ingenious design showcases how negative space matters in design and how "not drawing" is sometimes a better way of conveying information.

## Irradiation Phenomenon

The Irradiation Phenomenon refers to the case when we invert the color of a black logo on a white background. The inverted logo would turn out to be thicker than the original one, even though the lines are of identical weights [@paget_optical_2016]. In order to render the logo optically correct, we often thin the lines to make them appear the same weight as the original lines.

Human brains are strange: they see things not to their exact sizes, and they see things that do not exist. However, these bizarre mechanisms inspired designers to "design for the eyes, not for the grid" [@imagesmith_optical_2020]. These principles are pervasive in our daily life, so much so that we usually don't realize when the design is tweaked to trick our eyes. I hope that this article introduces you to optical correction in our world and potentially use it to create intuitive designs.
