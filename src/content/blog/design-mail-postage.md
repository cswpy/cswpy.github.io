# Designing for Mail Postages -- Stamp Design

Arguably the smallest canvas a designer has to work with is probably a postage stamp -- a space that is approximately 22 mm by 25 mm in size. However, this in no way imply that stamp design is easy. As communications means has already progressed beyond mails, stamp functions increasingly more like a piece of art instead of its initial purpose of indicating prepayment of postages. This means that stamps now carry a symbolic meaning with it, which is entirely manifested in its design. Indeed, stamps nowadays are often used to commemorate significant historical events and represent a nation's identity. However, unlike type design and graphic design, stamp design remains a relatively niche area with few resources online. In this article, I would like to provide a brief overview of stamp design.

## Basics of Stamp Design

Stamp, by textbook definition, is an indication of postage prepayment. Therefore, the most functional components of a stamp are denomination, which indicates the price for this particular postage, and country name, which indicates the origin of the letter. The third component is graphic design, which usually comes in the forms of portrait bust, emblem, numeric, and pictorial. Last but not least, it has the textual elements that may have something to do with the subject of the graphic design (the person being portrayed, the commemorative occasion etc.).

While the majority of stamps are square/rectangle, there are few stamps that takes other shapes, such as triangles, rhombuses, octagons, circles, and even a banana-shaped stamp, issued by Tonga from 1969 to 1985.

The process of issuing a new stamps is also similar to ordinary design commissions, but a lot stricter in many ways. For example, in UK, the Royal Mail researchers will propose 10 suitable subjects that have national significance to UK in every 5 years and then 4 designers are chosen to work on the prototypes. They would have to work with the Design Department of Royal Mail to produce a finished design, which will be approved by the Stamp Advisory Committee before printing ([Postal Museum](https://www.postalmuseum.org/collections/stamp-design/#)).

## The Niche of Graphic Design

Why would I say stamp design is a niche of graphic design? First of all, not everybody, or not even every designer, get the chance to design a stamp in their lives. There are only so many number of stamps will be issued every year and only a selective group of designer with abundant experiences get the job. Secondly, it is a matter of national identity since stamp design are often commissioned by governments, who attempts to convey a message through its design; this means that the design space is highly limited, at least until the digital age.

Nevertheless, there were many type and graphic designers who were involved in stamp design. For example, Herman Zapf, the type designer of Palatino and Optima, designed a series of stamps for Deutsche Bundespost in 1950s. The stamp below is one of his design in commemoration of 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci.

Another stamp I really liked is from Min Wang, who was the chair of design in 2008 Olympic Games Beijing. The stamp below is in a series of stamps to commemorate the Olympic Games 2008, showing basketball.

Last but not least, on October 25th class, the guest speaker Haytham Nawar spoke about Arab designers and mentioned Mohieddin El Labbad, who designed the stamp below in support of Palestine.

Enough name- and stamp-droppings here. I will leave links to resources that hosts many more brilliant stamp design. There are also serious consequences when stamp design goes wrong. For example, the _Statue of Liberty Forever_ stamp was issued by USPS in 2010. It turns out that the Statue of Liberty image used in the stamp is not the original, New York one, but the replica in Las Vegas. USPS had to pay $3.5 million for copyright infringement to the sculptor who created the replica ([U.S News](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/nevada/articles/2018-07-04/wrong-lady-liberty-on-stamp-to-cost-us-postal-service-35m)). Nowadays, people could even design your own stamp on USPS, check out this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/technology/personaltech/how-to-design-your-own-postage-stamps.html) by New York Times on how to create your own stamps.
